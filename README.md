# color-sorting
A pneumatic bot that detect and sort multiple objects of different colors simultaneously .
This project is about creating a bot using pneumatics that sorts objects by their colors. The robot utilizes an Arduino to control various components ,including dc motors, color sensors, solenoids and pistons, creating a fully automated system capable of detecting and sorting items based on their color 


Features:
COLOR DETECTION: uses color sensors to detect the color of an object.

PNEUMATIC SORTING SYSTEM: Sorts objects by color with the help of solenoids and pistons.

AUTOMATED CONVEYOR: Moves objects along the conveyor belt, stopping them in the sorting area

Microcontroller-Based: Powered by Arduino ,allowing easy modifications and control.


Components used:
Arduino Nano
Color Sensor
DC Motors
L29N
Solenoids
Pistons
Air Compressor
Power supply

Software used :
Arduino IDE
LIBRARY-
TCS3200
